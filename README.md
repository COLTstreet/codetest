### Instructions

Build a functioning to-do list using the screenshots provided as a guide. 

Ground rules:

* You may build it using whatever you want, just make sure it looks and acts like the one in the screenshots. (Hint: since you're applying for a front end developer job, you might want to use front end technologies. There's no need to save data in database.)
* You can look up stuff on the Google but don't ask others for help. 
* Be prepared to explain and account for all bits of code.

Basic functionality:

* 'Add' button should highlight on input keypress (todo-step2.png)
* Input value should be added to list when 'return' key is pressed
* Check icon should display on checkbox mouseover (todo-step4.png)
* To-do item should be removed when checkbox is checked

Dimensions: 

* width 400px
* min-height 300px
